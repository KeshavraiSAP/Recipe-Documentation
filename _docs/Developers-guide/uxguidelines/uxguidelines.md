# UX Guidelines

The Recipe UI guidelines serve two goals:

-   Enable a consistent user interface (look, feel and function as expected by our users)
-   Provide re-usable patterns and code snippets for UI developers

## Other Guidelines (Fiori)

The UI is implemented using SAPUI5 control libraries, which are based on the Fiori design system. If you can not find what you are looking for here, you can always refer to the <a href="https://ux.wdf.sap.corp/fiori-design-web/" target="_blank">Fiori Design Guidelines</a> which are the basis for our own guidelines.

We try to always align our own guidance with the Fiori Design Guidelines. It can still happen that there are conflicts. In that case, please follow the documented guidance. **Being consistent is always more important than being correct!**
