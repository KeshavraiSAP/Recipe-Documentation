Code released needs to be of high quality and there are general <a href="https://github.wdf.sap.corp/pages/ADI/cockpitDocs/getting-started/karma/" target="_blank">guidelines</a>(by cockpit) for setting up the unit, automation tests for recipe .

## *Sonar*
We use <a href="https://sonarci.wdf.sap.corp:8443/sonar/dashboard?id=com.sap.core.account%3Acockpit-module-recipe" target="_blank">Sonar</a> to analyse our source code. Reports are updated on a daily basis with the master branch.
 So you need to merge your changes to see the results.

There you can get an overview about the test coverage, bugs, code smells and code duplication.
