# Contributor Responsibilities

You chose to become a contributor. We're excited to have you on board! What's next?

It is important to understand that contributing is not a one-off delivery, but a long-term commitment to develop and maintain your UIs. By becoming a contributor, you have the following responsibilities:

- Follow our UX Guidelines and keep your UIs up-to-date, regardless of whether you deliver new features for your service or not
- If you make changes to existing UIs, make sure they are reviewed by the UX and UA team
- Provide unit tests, in order to keep the code quality high and regressions low
- If you plan major changes or a go-live, discuss them with bluestone team before the start of the implementation sprint
